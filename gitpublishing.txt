# To publish your code on git, follow the following steps:

# First step is to make a new github repository on github, and then follow these steps on your terminal which are also given there on github, once you create your repo there.

1. Firstly make sure that your github is setup for publishing, SSH key initialization.

2. After settting up the github, you need to write the following command in the terminal:

=> git init 
This will initialize your code

3. create a .gitignore file and add node_modules and .env file in it.

4. write the next command which is : 
=> git add . (This will add all the files of your code on github, except .gitignore and the files written within the .gitignore file).

5. A warning came which showed that my package.json file was in LF (unix/linux line ending) but I was on windows, due to which on next touch, the git will replace LF from CRLF (windows line ending).

=> LF stands for Line Feed
=> CRLF stands for Carriage return + Line Feed

# This warning can be ignored, as github manages it on its own.

6. After that write the command: 
=> git commit -m "first commit"

=> This showed that Author identity unknown
=> For this I ran two commands:

i. git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
(you use your general email id, and "" are important)

ii. git config --global user.name "Your name"
("Saksham280504")

7. Again run the command:
=> git commit -m "first commit"

=>[master (root-commit) efdd905] first commit
 6 files changed, 950 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 gitpublishing.txt
 create mode 100644 index.js
 create mode 100644 info.txt
 create mode 100644 package-lock.json
 create mode 100644 package.json

# This means that all the files are now ready for push.

8. write the command:
=> git branch -M main

9. write the command:
=> git remote add origin https://github.com/Saksham280504/ChaiaurBackend.git

10.write the command:
git push -u origin main

11. Do your login on github and allow the transfer

12.After that:
