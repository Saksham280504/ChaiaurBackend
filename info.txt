1. npm init :- We use this code in the terminal to initialize an application from node package manager(npm). 
2. If following error occurs:
'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

This means that we're using the ls command in windows command prompt, which doesn't recognize Unix-style commands like ls.

to fix this, we use the following command in Windows Command Prompt:

C:\Users\sanya\Developer\chai-aur-deploy>dir

instead of:
C:\Users\sanya\Developer\chai-aur-deploy>ls ( we use this in bash, Powershell, or Git Bash).

3. If a file is showing in terminal when we use dir, then we can run that file using node file.js

4. But to run that from package.json, we need to form certain script commands.

By writing a script command such as:

"start": "node index.js"

what happens is basically when you write npm run start in your terminal, the command node index.js will get executed from your package.json file.

# Doing this is beneficial while building a server.
